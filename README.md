## Question 1:
Given an integer N. Print the number from 1 to N and for multiple of “3” print “Fizz” instead of the number,
for the multiple of “5” print “Buzz” and for both 3 and 5 print “FizzBuzz”,

Sample input: N = 10

Sample output: 1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz.

## Question 2:
Given an integer N. Check whether N is prime or not. (Prime or NotPrime)

Sample input: N = 10

Sample output: NotPrime

## Question 3:
Reverse the given array without any inbuilt function.

Sample input: [2, -5, 6, 5, -8, 7, 5, 4, 6].

Solution output: [6, 4, 5, 7, -8, 5, 6, -5, 2]

## Question 4:

Given an array of integers and a target value, you must determine which two integers' sum equals the target
and return a 2D array. Then merge the array into a single array with sorting ( ascending ) order, in the next
step double the target value and find again the combination of digits (can be multiple digits ) that are equal to
the double targeted value and returned into a 2D array.

Sample input: [1, 3, 2, 2, -4, -6, -2, 8]; Target Value = 4,

Solution output:

First Combination For “4” : [ [1,3],[2,2],[-4,8],[-6,2] ];

Merge Into a single Array : [-6,-4,1,2,2,2,3,8];

Second Combination For “8” : [ [ 1,3,2,2], [8,-4,2,2],....,[n,n,n,n] ]
